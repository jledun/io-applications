# io-applications

## What ?

Empty MVC project including :

* a fresh start of loopback API with local auth and loopback-sdk-builder set without realtime application
* a fresh start of an Angular 4 / bootstrap 4 application with complete loopback sdk at start

## Why ?

To start a brand new MVC application, node.js and loopback on the server, Angular 4+ for front view.

I'll try to add standards modules for fields, tables, buttons and every needed thing after commissionnings.

## How ?

Three parts :
* io-lbapp : loopback application, server side
* io-ngapp : front end application, building in static pages of loopback based on Angular 5 & bootstrap 4 & font-awesome 4
* io-ngapp/src/app/shared/io-nglib : modules, services, components usefull and reusable for IO Systems Angular applications => this should be object for a different repository.
